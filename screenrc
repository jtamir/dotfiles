#Start or re-attach: screen -DR. Think of it as the screen doctor. This is the first thing I type after I ssh into a remote machine. If screen is already running, it attaches to it, otherwise it starts a new session.
#
#Essential Commands
#
#All screen commands start with Ctrl-a.
#
#Move between terminals: Ctrl-a <num>, so to go to window 1, hold down Ctrl and press a. Release Ctrl, and press number 1.
#Detach: Ctrl-a d. This is what I type at the end of the day. That leaves everything as it is, and I can re-attach to the sessions next time I ssh in.
#Exit:Ctrl-a \. Closes all your terminals and exits screen. I very rarely use this.
#Help: Ctrl-a ?. The help is pretty opaque. Hence this blog post :-)
#Create: Ctrl-a c. Creates a new terminal. When youâ€™re done using it, simply exit like you normally would. If you find yourself often creating more terminals, edit your .screenrc to start with more.
